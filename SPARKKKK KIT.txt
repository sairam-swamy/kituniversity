SQL : CRUD : BIGDATA : TB OR PB
SQL SERVER (10 TO 15 MINUTES)  : TRANSFORMATION : HARD : TIME 

5 SQL SERVERS : 1TB DATASET INTO 4*250GB DATA 

SPARK : BIG DATA ANALYTICAL ENGINE : IT WILL USE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING TO PERFORM QUERIES AND WILL GIVE RESULT IN SHORTER TIME.

IT WILL TAKE MULTIPLE MACHINES AND IT WILL PERFORM TRANSFORMATIONS BY DISTRIBUTING THE TASKS ACROSS ALL THE MACHINES.

CLUSTER : GROUP OF MACHINES


USER HAS GIVEN A INPUT TO SPARK CLUSTER 

CLUSTER MANAGER : MACHINES RESOURCES : 4GB RAM 4VCPU 512GB SSD 

DRIVER PROGRAM WILL TAKE THE INPUT AND IT WILL DISTRIBUTE THE INPUT TO WORKER NODES AT THE BACKEND

SPARK USES IN MEMORY PROCESSING : IT STORES THE DATA IN MEMORY AND IF THE DATA NEEDS TO GET RETRIEVED IT WILL TAKE IT FROM MEMORY AND WILL GIVE TO USER AS OUTPUT.

MASSIVE PARALELL PROCESSING : THE INPUT GIVEN BY USER WILL BE DIVIDED INTO PARTITIONS BY SPARK AND EACH PARTITION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENT WORKERS AND EACH WORKER WILL STARTS PROCESSING THE PARTITION ALL WORKERS START PROCESSING PARTITIONS PARALELLY.

DAG : DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH : IT ACTS LIKE A BLUE PRINT OF HOW THE USER INPUT HAS BEEN DIVIDED IN TO PARTITIONS AND HOW THE PARTITIONS HAS BEEN PROCESSED BY WORKER NODES AND HOW THE EXECUTORS EXECUTED THE PROCESSES ETC.


JOB : GET THE NO OF PEOPLE BORN BETWEEN JAN1ST 2000 TO JAN 1ST 2025
  STAGE : 

     S-1 : GET NO OF PEOPLE FROM PEOPLE TABLE
     S-2 : GET DATA FROM DATE TABLE
    TASKS 
        STAGE -1 
        TASK -1 : COLLECT PEOPLE DETAILS LIKE NAME
        STAGE-2  
        TASK -1 : FILTER OPERATION BASED ON DATES.

PYSPARK == PYTHON + SPARK

SSIS : AZURE DATA FACTORY : AZURE


SPARK INSTALLATION AND SPARK DRIVER PROGRAM INITIATION : CREATION OF SPARK CONTEXT : DATABRICKS


SQL : TABLES : ROWS AND COLUMNS : TABLE : DATA STRUCTURE OF SQL

SPARK HAS TWO DATA STRUCTURES

1) RDD : RESILIENT DISTRIBUTED DATASET
2) DATAFRAME : ADVANCED RDD OR EQUIVALENT TO TABLE IN SQL

RDD : IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL LOW LEVEL DATA STRUCTURE IN APACHE SPARK. IT IS A IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED COLLECTION OF OBJECTS THAT CAN BE PROCESSED IN PARALELL.

RESILIENT : AUTOMATIC RECOVERY OF DATA IN CASE OF NODE FAILURES.
DISTRIBUTED : THE DATA IS SPLIT ACROSS MULTIPLE NODES IN THE CLUSTER.
DATASET : IT IS A COLLECTION OF RECORDS


HADOOP, MAPREDUCE : USED DISKS : SLOW I/O PERFORMANCE : MACHINE LEARNING COMPLEX COMPUTING ETC.

RDD : KEEP DATA IN MEMORY : FASTER THAN DISK, GTRACK HOW THE DATA WAS CREATED AND IT CAN RECOMPUTE OR RECOVER LOST DATA.

YOU NEED TO PERFORM LOWER LEVEL GTRANSFORMATION 
YOU NEED TO WORK WITH UNSTRUCTURED OR SEMI STRUCTURED DATA 


DATAFRAMES : HIGH LEVEL DATA STRUCTURE IN APACHE SPARK. IT IS A SCHEMA AWARE DATA STRUCTURE. THIS WORKS WITH SCHEMA ORIENTED DATA. BEST UTILISED FOR SQL QUERIES, BIG DATA AND ETL WORLOADS.
